# Vision

The Industrial Digital Twin Platform is designed to model, monitor, and predict the behavior of industrial equipment using telemetry and visual data. It supports predictive maintenance and defect detection workflows by integrating time-series prognostics and computer vision pipelines into a unified architecture.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Predictive Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction using NASA Turbofan telemetry.
- Visual anomaly/defect detection using the MVTec AD dataset.
- Distributed inference services with versioned model deployment.
- API and dashboard interfaces for results and interaction.
- Model registry for deployment lifecycle management.

**Out of scope:**
- Real hardware integration with physical sensors.
- Certified real-time control logic.
- Multi-tenant enterprise authentication.
